1:	This code is where a lot of the variables used later on
in the script are defined, it is also where the user is prompted to select
a Live ISO from ~/dpatches/distros

2:	This loop couldve been done better, it basically searches the entire Live ISO
for any file that can be identified as a squashfs, writes the file path to that squashfs to a map file inside the help folder,
and it creates a dummy of the squashfs to store the name of it, since you want to make sure that the name of the patch is identical to the original
so that the Live ISO doesnt freak out when you try to boot it up. The dummy is utilized in section 5.

3:	This small step is very important, you dont want to clutter the user's /mnt directory with garbage.

4:	This is the fun part, it searches ~/dpatches/MYSCRIPTS for any directory. The user is free to put anything inside those
directories. A future plan is to implement an API to extend the functionality of this script so you can do much more, like append to
the .bashrc of the root file inside the squashfs-root. Unfortunately, I dont know how to do this.

5:	This is the final step of the process where the squashfs-root is compiled into a new squashfs with the same name as the original, 
this is where the dummy comes into play. I store the name of the dummy inside a variable and kill the dummy,then i feed that variable into
the mksquashfs command. Then, I give instructions to the user on how to patch the Live ISO they chose.
